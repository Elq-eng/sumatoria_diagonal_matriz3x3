# Given two strings a and b, both consisting only of lowercase English letters, your task is to calculate how many strings equal to a can be constructed using only letters from the string b? Each letter can be used only once and in one string only.

# Example

# For a = "abc" and b = "abccba", the output should be stringsConstruction(a, b) = 2.

# We can construct 2 strings a = "abc" using only letters from the string b.

# For a = "ab" and b = "abcbcb", the output should be stringsConstruction(a, b) = 1.

# Input/Output

# [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

# [input] string a

# String to construct, containing only lowercase English letters.

# Guaranteed constraints:
# 1 ≤ a.length ≤ 105.

# [input] string b

# String containing needed letters, containing only lowercase English letters.

# Guaranteed constraints:
# 1 ≤ b.length ≤ 105.

# [output] integer

# The number of strings a that can be constructed from the string b.
